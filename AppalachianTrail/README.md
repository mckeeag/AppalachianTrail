# AppalachianTrail
## Map Description
This is a map of a section of the Appalachian Trail that begins at US Highway 19E and ends at Jones Branch, located in eastern Tennesee.  
## Map Data Sources
The trail route was sourced from the hiking app AllTrails, which provides .gpx files of trail routes for direct download.
The map features a USGS topographic basemap with elevation markers, sourced from Leaflet.

## Map Libraries
This map utilized the jQuery library, the Leaflet Provider library, and the Google Fonts API.

## Map Functions
The map's primary feature is the trail route itself, which is highlighted in an orange/red color.
I added four markers to the map that have clickable labels. There are markers for the start point of the trail, the end point of the trail, a creek crossing on the trail, and a cemetery close to the trail. 
I have also provided a link to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy's Tennesee page for more information.
